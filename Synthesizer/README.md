# Modal synthesizer
Based on Perry Cook's modal synthesizer, found in [this course](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/physics-based-sound-synthesis-for-games-and-interactive-systems-iv/info).

## Usage

The synthesizer is set to the parameters used in the coffee mug (including the residue file). Just open the Modal_Synth_mug.ck in ChucK and use it as any other ChucK program.
